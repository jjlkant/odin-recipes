# odin-recipes

This repository is dedicated to the implementation of the `odin-recipes` project of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

This project is aimed at putting HTML knowledge gained during the Odin Project course so far into practice by building a basic recipe website.

The desired website will consist of a main index page with links to several recipes. This will consist solely of HTML and therefore will not look very pretty, the project will be revisted later to be styled up with CSS.
